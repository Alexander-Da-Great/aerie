*<p align="center">**Figure 16:** Guides are green lines across all the data bands in the Bands Panels.</p>*

Users can add guides to mark a point in time to all the data bands drawn in the Bands Panels. The user can turn on the `Show Last Click` option in the [Global Band Settings](./Raven_101_3_bands.md#global-settings) panel. If `Show Last Click` is on, when the user clicks any band at any point in the timeline, it will add a Ghost Line marking to the selected time as shown in **Figure 17**. It is **important** to note that the Ghost Line is not the guide itself, as guides are colored green and exhibit perminence. Guides will be created on the last selected point in time, which can be represented by the Ghost Line.
