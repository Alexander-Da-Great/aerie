/**
 * A solver over a continuous dynamics for a resource type and conditions against that resource.
 *
 * <p>
 *   A dynamics is a continuous function from time (the real line) into a space of resource values (the resource type).
 *   A condition is a continuous function from the resource space into the space of boolean valuations,
 *   also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_space">Sierpi≈Ñski space</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   A solver is able to perform two kinds of computations: solve a dynamics for its value at a time,
 *   and solve the composition of a dynamics and a condition -- in sum, a continuous function from time to truth values
 *   -- for the windows of time over which the condition is true.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <Resource> The topological space of resource values under discussion.
 * @param <Dynamics> The type of continuous time-dependent resource behaviors.
 * @param <Condition> The type of Boolean conditions on resource values.
