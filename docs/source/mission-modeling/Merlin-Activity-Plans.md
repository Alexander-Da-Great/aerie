Aerie provides an API to manage a database of plans. The database of plans may be queried for a list of all plans, and new plans may be added to the repository. Existing plans may be retrieved in full, replaced in full or in part, or deleted in full. The list of activities in a plan may be appended to (by creating a new activity) and retrieved in full. Individual activities in a plan may be retrieved in full, replaced in full or in part, and deleted in full. How to execute queries and mutations against the Aerie API is found in the [GraphQL software interface specification](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/wiki/Aerie-GraphQL-API-Software-Interface-Specification).

Operations on plans are validated to ensure consistency with the mission model-specific activity model with which they are associated. Stored plans shall contain activities whose parameter names and types are defined by the associated activity type.
