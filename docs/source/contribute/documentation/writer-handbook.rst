Write content
=============

When writing content for Aerie, we use an informal topic-based writing approach.
We generally try to guide our writing and organization by the
`Divio Documentation System <https://documentation.divio.com/>`_:

* Tutorial --- Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project or task of some kind.
* Procedural --- Gives instructions on how to use the subject
* Referential --- Gives additional information about the particular topic
* All content must be written in US English. Use as few words as possible and try to keep the reading level to under grade 8. You can use word counters and readability tests to keep the reading level down.

Write procedures
................

Each procedure should have an introductory paragraph (1-3 sentences) which explains what the procedure does, when you should use it, and what benefit the procedure provides.
After the introduction, there should be a numbered list of steps. Use the following guidelines to write the steps:

* Each step should be one single action.
* Steps should be written in clear, simple vocabulary that is easy to follow. If the step includes a code snippet, a screenshot of the expected outcome should follow.
* If the procedure includes changing a configuration, the next step should include how to verify that the configuration change was successful.
* Wherever possible, instructions on how to reverse the action should also be included (not part of the original procedure, but included in a separate procedure.
