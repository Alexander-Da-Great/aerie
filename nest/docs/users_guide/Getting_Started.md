# RAVEN

### About

RAVEN is a component of the web-based platform NEST. NEST is the Mission Planning, Sequencing and Analysis (MPSA) Team's platform to provide a cohesive user experience to multi-mission users that require activity planning, sequencing, validation and analysis capabilities.  RAVEN's role within this platform is to allow users to view science planning, spacecraft activities, resource usage and predicted data, and/or any time-based data. The visualization happens in the context of a timeline via a web browser. Moreover, this information can be viewed simultaneously by different users/teams distributed in different geographical location with the purpose of collaboration when visualizing activity plans and command sequences. 

### Getting Stated

#### Graph your data

To Start, open RAVEN using the link provided from your system administrator. [What I'm I looking at?](./Raven_101_1_application_layout.md)

The "Left Panel" in the application is the Source Explorer. In the Source Explorer you can navigate between your sources and select the items that you want to visualize. 

The (<img src="./images/chart-area.svg" width="20" />) icon in the source explorer denotes a graphable source. It means that when you click on it, it will be displayed in a time band on the main panel.  [What do the icons mean?](./Raven_101_2_source_explorer.md#iconography)

*Voila!* A new band will be added in the "Bands Panel" with your data.

#### Taking a closer look

There are many different ways to see your data in more detail. To do so, you can zoom in/out on a section of the band that is being currently displayed. Upon the first selection of a graphable source two bands have been added:

1. The Timeline Band 
2. A Band containing the data selected

The Timeline Band will always be on the top of your data. You can select a section of the Timeline Band and this will zoom your data to the selected range, or use the Zoom In(<img src="./images/search-plus.svg" width="15" />)/Zoom Out (<img src="./images/search-minus.svg" width="15" />) buttons at the top of the application. [How do I manipulate the range view?](./Raven_101_3_bands.md#manipulate-time-range)

#### A Deeper Dive into your Data

If you want to see more information about your data; click on the band's label to select it.

1. The "Details Panel" will be populated with a table that displays all the Data Points in your band's source.
2. On the Right Panel you will notice different options that will allow you to change the settings of your band is displayed. [How do I style my drawn bands?](./Raven_101_3_bands.md#band-type-configuration-options)

Do you want to take a deeper dive into your data? Select a data point in your band.

1. The "Details Panel" will automatically scroll to the band and highlight the data point.
2. On the "Right Panel", go to the "Selected Point" tab to see more information about your data point.
