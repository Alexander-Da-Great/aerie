Configuring a Mission Model
===========================

A **mission model configuration** enables mission modelers to set initial mission model values when running a simulation.
Configurations are tied to a plan, therefore each plan is able to define its own set of configuration parameters.
The |examples/bananation|_ project contains a ``Configuration`` data class example to demonstrate how a simple configuration may be created.
