If you are reading this guide because you have decided to contribute to Aerie, thank you!
Below you'll find a guide on how to get your own version of Aerie running for development.

If instead you would like to contribute to Aerie's UI, you'll find instructions on how to do so `at our sister repo <https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui>`_.

For guidelines on contributing, see :doc:`here <../guidelines/index>`.
