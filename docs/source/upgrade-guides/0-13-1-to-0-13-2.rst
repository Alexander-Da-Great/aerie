================
0.13.1 To 0.13.2
================

Migrating a mission model from 0.13.1 to 0.13.2 will require two modifications.

1. The ``spawn()`` and ``defer()`` calls in an activity effect model now return ``void``, rather than ``String``.

2. ``spawn()`` now takes the mission model as a parameter. For example ``spawn(mission, new PeelBananaActivity());``

3. The ``waitFor(String id)`` has been replaced with ``call(final TaskFactory<T> task)``. There is
no change in the semantics.

For further information see the docs for :doc:`activity effect modeling <../mission-modeling/activities>`

Update Java Version 19
----------------------
Mission modelers will need to install a  `Java 19 JDK <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=19>`_. in
order to use builds of the Merlin libraries after this change, but existing built mission models should continue
to work. Customer deployments which take Aerie Docker images should continue to do so; no additional effort should
be required
