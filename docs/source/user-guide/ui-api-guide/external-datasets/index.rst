   Managing External Datasets <managing>
   Usage in Constraints Checking <usage-constraints>

A dataset is a collection of Real (numeric) and Discrete (any type) profiles which all start at the same time. Most datasets
are created by simulation, but sometimes it will be helpful to import data that can't be simulated by Merlin, so it can
be used in constraint checking and scheduler evaluation.
