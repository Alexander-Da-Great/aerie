# Raven2

Resource and Activity Visualization Engine v2.

RAVEN is a web-based platform included in the SEQ subsystem of the Advanced Multimission Operations System (AMMOS) and managed by the Multimission Ground System and Services (MGSS). It allows users to view science planning, spacecraft activities, resource usage and predicted data, or any time -based data, displayed in a timeline format via web browser. Subsequently, it can be viewed simultaneously by distributed users/teams for collaboration when creating, updating and validating activity plans and command sequences.


## Develop

```
npm i
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
